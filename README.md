# HISTEX
- This repository contains the implementation for our work "Inferring Super-Resolved Gene Expression by Integrating Histology Images and Spatial Transcriptomics with HISTEX", early accepted by **MICCAI 2025**
## Introduction
The groundbreaking development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables researchers to map gene expression across tissues with spatial precision. However, current next-generation sequencing methods, which theoretically cover the entire transcriptome, face limitations in resolving spatial gene expression at high resolution. The recently introduced Visium HD technology offers a balance between sequencing depth and spatial resolution, but its complex sample preparation and high cost limit its widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we introduce HISTEX, a multimodal fusion approach that leverages a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism and a general-purpose foundation model. HISTEX integrates spot-based ST data with histology images to predict super-resolution (SR) spatial gene expression. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HISTEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately predicting SR gene expression across diverse datasets from multiple platforms. Moreover, experimental validation underscores HISTEXâ€™s potential to generate new biological insights. It enhances spatial patterns, enriches biologically significant pathways, and facilitates the SR annotation of tissue structures. These findings highlight HISTEX as a powerful tool for advancing ST research.

## Requirements
All experiments were conducted on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. Before running HISTEX, you need to create a conda environment and install the required packages:
```shell
conda create -n HISTEX python==3.11.5
conda activate HISTEX
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

## Pre-trained general-purpose foundation mode
Given the outstanding performance of large pre-trained general-purpose foundation models in clinical tasks, we use UNI as the backbone feature extractor. Before using HISTEX, you need to apply to UNI for permission to access the model weights: [https://huggingface.co/mahmoodlab/UNI](https://huggingface.co/mahmoodlab/UNI).

## Training and Inferring
- First, histology image and location information are normalized by running [`image_calibration.py`](image_calibration.py).
- Second, high-density spot-based ST data and histological features are acquired by running [`get_HR.py`](get_HR.py) and [`Histology_Extractor.py`](Histology_Extractor.py).
- Third, mask file is obtained to filter out non-tissue areas by running [`masking_non_tissue.py`](masking_non_tissue.py).
- Finally, super-resolution gene expression profiles are generated by running [`HISTEX.py`](HISTEX.py).
```shell
python image_calibration.py --directory dataset\\
python Step1_get_HR.py --directory dataset\\
python Step2_Histology_Extractor.py --directory dataset\\ --login ***
python Step3_masking_non_tissue.py --directory dataset\\
python Step4_HISTEX_demo.py --directory dataset\\ --epochs 500 --n-states 5
```
`--directory` represents the directory of your dataset, and `--login` represents the key of the UNI model you own.
